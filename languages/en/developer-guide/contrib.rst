Contribution
============

All developments should be announced on tuleap-devel mailing list.

By announcing what you want to do in advance, you limit the risk of developing something that will not be integrated because it conflicts with plan/vision of other developers.
Moreover you can get meaningful feedback on what to do and how to do it.

By all means try to contribute small things. It's far easier to review and integrate 100 lines of diff in 3 files rather than 5000 lines in 30 files.

Communication channels
----------------------

You should have an account on:

    https://tuleap.net

You should register to following mailing lists:

- tuleap-events: All push and CI job failure (big traffic)
- tuleap-devel: All discussions related to tuleap development (medium traffic) and ask for proper accreditation in order to be able to contribute.

Present a new feature
---------------------

For new features, the best way to present them is one (or several) user stories written on the "In order to <receive benefit> as a <role>, I want <goal/desire>" model.
A good user story is a story worth to INVEST on:

- Independant
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimable
- Small
- Testable
