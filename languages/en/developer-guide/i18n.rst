Internationalization
====================

Because Tuleap is used by a large community of users and developpers, it is internationalized. For now, available languages are:

- English
- French

Thus, there shouldn't be any words or sentences of natural language in source code.

The class that manage i18n is BaseLanguage (src/common/language/BaseLanguage.class.php). A typical use in PHP is

  .. code-block:: bash

    $Language->getText('include_exit','error'));

    $Language is initialized by pre.php, and language is set regarding the user preferences. This php code will be replaced by a string defined in languages file.

Language files are available in site-content directory. For instance, the file used in the example is located at site-content/en_US/include/include.tab. Same file exists for french version: site-content/fr_FR/include/include.tab.

These language files follow a defined syntax:

  .. code-block:: bash

    key1 [tab] key2 [tab] translated string

and are separated by a carriage return. Keys are splitted in different files for convenience, but are "compiled" in a big unique file at execution.
